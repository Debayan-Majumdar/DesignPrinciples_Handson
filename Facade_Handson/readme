Façade Pattern Hands On

We have a scenario where we have set of classes to draw different shapes. The requirement is to create a façade for these objects so that they are not exposed to the client.


Exercise

1. Create /Implementation of the interfaces with their methods as shown in the above UML diagram

2. Implement the methods to the draw to print the name of the shape of the class

3. Implement a ShapeMaker class to create simple methods to draw each of the shape

4. Implement a Demo class which will invoke the façade and use it to draw the shapes

5. Validate the output by running the code snippet

6. Please provide any two business scenarios where Façade pattern will be useful

7. Also how would you handle the situation if there are more shapes added in the future?
