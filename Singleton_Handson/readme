Singleton Pattern- Hands on exercise.

An online shopping web application makes multiple calls from different services to the database. The requirement is to restrict creation of multiple data base connection objects everytime a caller requests for a connection object. Please implement a DBCon class which will return the same instance of the class, irrespective of the requests

Exercise Steps

1. Create a DBConn class with a static private member – ‘instance’ to hold its own instance.

2. Create a new instance of the object and assign it to the instance variable.

3. Make the constructor of the class as private

4. Implement a ‘getInstance()’ static method to return the instance variable.

5. Implement a caller method to call this method to get the instance

Points to ponder

1. What will happen if you don’t make the constructor as private?

2. What happens to the class if static keywords are attached to a member.?

3. Will you be able to instantiate the object without ‘new’ operator?
